 </strong></font> As unique and spectacular as Greek or Roman architecture, <a class = 'glossary' href = 'javascript:void(0)' onmouseover = 'new Tip(this, "A Central America Civilization")'>Maya</a> architecture spans many thousands of years; yet, often the most dramatic and easily recognizable as <a class = 'glossary' href = 'javascript:void(0)' onmouseover = 'new Tip(this, "A Central America Civilization")'>Maya</a> are the fantastic stepped pyramids from the Terminal Pre-classic period and beyond. </font><br /> 
 <font size="2"> 
 </font><br /> 
 <font size="2"> 
There are also cave sites that are important to the <a class = 'glossary' href = 'javascript:void(0)' onmouseover = 'new Tip(this, "A Central America Civilization")'>Maya</a>. These cave sites include Jolja Cave, the cave site at Naj Tunich, the Candelaria Caves, and the Cave of the Witch. There are also cave-origin myths among the <a class = 'glossary' href = 'javascript:void(0)' onmouseover = 'new Tip(this, "A Central America Civilization")'>Maya</a>. Some cave sites are still used by the modern <a class = 'glossary' href = 'javascript:void(0)' onmouseover = 'new Tip(this, "A Central America Civilization")'>Maya</a> in the Chiapas highlands. </font><br /> 
 <font size="2"> 
 </font><br /> 
 <font size="2"> 
It has been suggested that, in conjunction to the <a class = 'glossary' href = 'javascript:void(0)' onmouseover = 'new Tip(this, "A Central America Civilization")'>Maya</a> Long Count Calendar, every fifty-two years, or cycle, temples and pyramids were remodeled and rebuilt. It appears now that the rebuilding process was often instigated by a new ruler or for political matters, as opposed to matching the calendar cycle. However, the process of rebuilding on top of old structures is indeed a common one. Most notably, the North Acropolis at Tikal seems to be the sum total of 1,500 years of architectural modifications. In Tikal and YaxhÃ¡, there are the Twin Pyramid complexes (7 in Tikal and 1 in YaxhÃ¡, that commemorate the end of a BaktÃºn </font><br />

Through observation of the numerous consistent elements and stylistic distinctions, remnants of <a class = 'glossary' href = 'javascript:void(0)' onmouseover = 'new Tip(this, "A Central America Civilization")'>Maya</a> architecture have become an important key to understanding the evolution of their ancient civilization. </font><br />

 <strong> Urban design </strong></font><br /> 
 <font size="2"> 
 </font><br /> 
 <font size="2"> 
As <a class = 'glossary' href = 'javascript:void(0)' onmouseover = 'new Tip(this, "A Central America Civilization")'>Maya</a> cities spread throughout the varied geography of Mesoamerica, site planning appears to have been minimal. <a class = 'glossary' href = 'javascript:void(0)' onmouseover = 'new Tip(this, "A Central America Civilization")'>Maya</a> architecture tended to integrate a great degree of natural features, and their cities were built somewhat haphazardly as dictated by the topography of each independent location. For instance, some cities on the flat limestone plains of the northern YucatÃ¡n grew into great sprawling municipalities, while others built in the hills of Usumacinta utilized the natural loft of the topography to raise their towers and temples to impressive heights. However, some semblance of order, as required by any large city, still prevailed. </font><br /> 
 <font size="2"> 
 </font><br /> 
 <font size="2"> 
Classic Era <a class = 'glossary' href = 'javascript:void(0)' onmouseover = 'new Tip(this, "A Central America Civilization")'>Maya</a> urban design could easily be described as the division of space by great monuments and causeways. Open public plazas were the gathering places for people and the focus of urban design, while interior space was entirely secondary. Only in the Late Post-Classic era did the great <a class = 'glossary' href = 'javascript:void(0)' onmouseover = 'new Tip(this, "A Central America Civilization")'>Maya</a> cities develop into more fortress-like defensive structures that lacked, for the most part, the large and numerous plazas of the Classic. </font><br /> 
 <font size="2"> 
 </font><br /> 
 <font size="2"> 
At the onset of large-scale construction during the Classic Era, a predetermined axis was typically established in a cardinal direction. Depending on the location of natural resources such as fresh-water wells, or cenotes, the city grew by using sacbeob (causeways), (singular: SacbÃ©) to connect great plazas with the numerous platforms that created the sub-structure for nearly all <a class = 'glossary' href = 'javascript:void(0)' onmouseover = 'new Tip(this, "A Central America Civilization")'>Maya</a> buildings. As more structures were added and existing structures re-built or remodeled, the great <a class = 'glossary' href = 'javascript:void(0)' onmouseover = 'new Tip(this, "A Central America Civilization")'>Maya</a> cities seemed to take on an almost random identity that contrasted sharply with other great Mesoamerican cities such as Teotihuacan and its rigid grid-like construction. </font><br /> 
 <font size="2"> 
 </font><br /> 
 <font size="2"> 
At the heart of the <a class = 'glossary' href = 'javascript:void(0)' onmouseover = 'new Tip(this, "A Central America Civilization")'>Maya</a> city were large plazas surrounded by the most important governmental and religious buildings, such as the royal acropolis, great pyramid temples and occasionally ball-courts. Though city layouts evolved as nature dictated, careful attention was placed on the directional orientation of temples and observatories so that they were constructed in accordance with <a class = 'glossary' href = 'javascript:void(0)' onmouseover = 'new Tip(this, "A Central America Civilization")'>Maya</a> interpretation of the orbits of the heavenly bodies. Immediately outside of this ritual center were the structures of lesser nobles, smaller temples, and individual shrines; the less sacred and less important structures had a greater degree of privacy. Outside of the constantly evolving urban core were the less permanent and more modest homes of the common people. </font><br />

 <strong> Building materials </strong></font><br /> 
 <font size="2"> 
 </font><br /> 
 <font size="2"> 
A surprising aspect of the great <a class = 'glossary' href = 'javascript:void(0)' onmouseover = 'new Tip(this, "A Central America Civilization")'>Maya</a> structures is their lack of many advanced technologies seemingly necessary for such constructions. Lacking draft animals necessary for wheel-based modes of transportation, metal tools and even pulleys, <a class = 'glossary' href = 'javascript:void(0)' onmouseover = 'new Tip(this, "A Central America Civilization")'>Maya</a> architecture required abundant manpower. Yet, beyond this enormous requirement, the remaining materials seem to have been readily available. All stone for <a class = 'glossary' href = 'javascript:void(0)' onmouseover = 'new Tip(this, "A Central America Civilization")'>Maya</a> structures appears to have been taken from local quarries. They most often used limestone which remained pliable enough to be worked with stone tools while being quarried and only hardened once removed from its bed. In addition to the structural use of limestone, much of their mortar consisted of crushed, burnt and mixed limestone that mimicked the properties of cement and was used as widely for stucco finishing as it was for mortar. Later improvements in quarrying techniques reduced the necessity for this limestone-stucco as the stones began to fit quite perfectly, yet it remained a crucial element in some post and lintel roofs. In the case of the common <a class = 'glossary' href = 'javascript:void(0)' onmouseover = 'new Tip(this, "A Central America Civilization")'>Maya</a> houses, wooden poles, adobe and thatch were the primary materials; however, instances of what appear to be common houses of limestone have been discovered as well. Also notable throughout <a class = 'glossary' href = 'javascript:void(0)' onmouseover = 'new Tip(this, "A Central America Civilization")'>Maya</a> architecture is the corbel arch (also known as a &quot;false arch&quot;), whose limitations kept their structures generally weighty rather than airy. </font><br /> 
 <font size="2"> 
 </font><br /> 
 <font size="2"> 
 <strong> Notable constructions </strong></font><br /> 
 <font size="2"> 
 </font><br /> 
 <font size="2"> 
* Ceremonial platforms were commonly limestone platforms of typically less than four meters in height where public ceremonies and religious rites were performed. Constructed in the fashion of a typical foundation platform, these were often accented by carved figures, altars and perhaps tzompantli, a stake used to display the heads of victims or defeated Mesoamerican ballgame opponents. </font><br /> 
 <font size="2"> 
* Palaces were large and often highly decorated, and usually sat close to the center of a city and housed the population&#39;s elite. Any exceedingly large royal palace, or one consisting of many chambers on different levels might be referred to as an acropolis. However, often these were one-story and consisted of many small chambers and typically at least one interior courtyard; these structures appear to take into account the needed functionality required of a residence, as well as the decoration required for their inhabitants stature. </font><br /> 
 <font size="2"> 
* E-Groups are specific structural configurations present at a number of centers in the <a class = 'glossary' href = 'javascript:void(0)' onmouseover = 'new Tip(this, "A Central America Civilization")'>Maya</a> area. These complexes are oriented and aligned according to specific astronomical events (primarily the sunâs solstices and equinoxes) and are thought to have been observatories. These structures are usually accompanied by iconographic reliefs that tie astronomical observation into general <a class = 'glossary' href = 'javascript:void(0)' onmouseover = 'new Tip(this, "A Central America Civilization")'>Maya</a> mythology. The structural complex is named for Group E at Uaxactun, the first documented in Mesoamerica. </font><br /> 
 <font size="2"> 
* Pyramids and temples. Often the most important religious temples sat atop the towering <a class = 'glossary' href = 'javascript:void(0)' onmouseover = 'new Tip(this, "A Central America Civilization")'>Maya</a> pyramids, presumably as the closest place to the heavens. While recent discoveries point toward the extensive use of pyramids as tombs, the temples themselves seem to rarely, if ever, contain burials. Residing atop the pyramids, some of over two-hundred feet, such as that at El Mirador, the temples were impressive and decorated structures themselves. Commonly topped with a roof comb, or superficial grandiose wall, these temples might have served as a type of propaganda. As they were often the only structure in a <a class = 'glossary' href = 'javascript:void(0)' onmouseover = 'new Tip(this, "A Central America Civilization")'>Maya</a> city to exceed the height of the surrounding jungle, the roof combs atop the temples were often carved with representations of rulers that could be seen from vast distances. </font><br /> 
 <font size="2"> 
* Observatories. The <a class = 'glossary' href = 'javascript:void(0)' onmouseover = 'new Tip(this, "A Central America Civilization")'>Maya</a> were keen astronomers and had mapped out the phases of celestial objects, especially the Moon and Venus. Many temples have doorways and other features aligning to celestial events. Round temples, often dedicated to Kukulcan, are perhaps those most often described as &quot;observatories&quot; by modern ruin tour-guides, but there is no evidence that they were so used exclusively, and temple pyramids of other shapes may well have been used for observation as well. </font><br /> 
 <font size="2"> 
* Ball courts. As an integral aspect of the Mesoamerican lifestyle, the courts for their ritual ball-game were constructed throughout the <a class = 'glossary' href = 'javascript:void(0)' onmouseover = 'new Tip(this, "A Central America Civilization")'>Maya</a> realm and often on a grand scale. Enclosed on two sides by stepped ramps that led to ceremonial platforms or small temples, the ball court itself was of a capital &quot;I&quot; shape and could be found in all but the smallest of <a class = 'glossary' href = 'javascript:void(0)' onmouseover = 'new Tip(this, "A Central America Civilization")'>Maya</a> cities. </font><br />
