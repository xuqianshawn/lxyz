			How to Deal with Intermittent Bugs
			The intermittent bug is a cousin of the 50-foot-invisible-scorpion-from-outer-space kind of bug.
			This nightmare occurs so rarely that it is hard to observe, yet often enough that it can&#39;t be ignored.
			You can&#39;t debug it because you can&#39;t find it.<br />
			<br />
			Although after eight hours you will start to doubt it, the intermittent bug has to obey the same laws
			of logic everything else does. What makes it hard is that it occurs only under unknown conditions.
			Try to record the circumstances under which the bug does occur, so that you can guess at what the
			variability really is. The condition may be related to data values, such as âThis only happens when
			we enter Wyoming as a value.â If that is not the source of variability, the next suspect should be
			improperly synchronized concurrency.<br />
			<br />
			Try, try, try to reproduce the bug in a controlled way. If you can&#39;t reproduce it, set a trap for it by
			building a logging system, a special one if you have to, that can log what you guess you need
			when it really does occur. Resign yourself to that if the bug only occurs in production and not at
			your whim, this is may be a long process. The hints that you get from the log may not provide the
			solution but may give you enough information to improve the logging. The improved logging system
			may take a long time to be put into production. Then, you have to wait for the bug to reoccur
			to get more information. This cycle can go on for some time.<br />
			<br />
			The stupidest intermittent bug I ever created was in a multi-threaded implementation of a functional
			programming language for a class project. I had very carefully insured correct concurrent
			evaluation of the functional program, good utilization of all the CPUs available (eight, in this
			case). I simply forgot to synchronize the garbage collector. The system could run a long time, often
			finishing whatever task I began, before anything noticeable went wrong. I&#39;m ashamed to admit
			I had begun to question the hardware before my mistake dawned on me.<br />
			<br />
			At work we recently had an intermittent bug that took us several weeks to find. We have multithreaded
			application servers in Javaâ¢ behind Apacheâ¢ web servers. To maintain fast page turns,
			we do all I/O in small set of four separate threads that are different than the page-turning threads.
			Every once in a while these would apparently get âstuckâ and cease doing anything useful, so far
			as our logging allowed us to tell, for hours. Since we had four threads, this was not in itself a giant
			problem---unless all four got stuck. Then the queues emptied by these threads would quickly fill
			up all available memory and crash our server. It took us about a week to figure this much out, and
			we still didn&#39;t know what caused it, when it would happen, or even what the threads where doing
			when they got âstuckâ.<br />
			<br />
			This illustrates some risk associated with third-party software. We were using a licensed piece of
			code that removed HTML tags from text. Due to its place of origin we affectionately referred to
			this as âthe French stripper.â Although we had the source code (thank goodness!) we had not studied
			it carefully until by turning up the logging on our servers we finally realized that the email
			threads were getting stuck in the French stripper.<br />
			<br />
			The stripper performed well except on some long and unusual kinds of texts. On these texts, the
			code was quadratic or worse. This means that the processing time was proportional to the square
			of the length of the text. Had these texts occurred commonly, we would have found the bug right
			away. If they had never occurred at all, we would never have had a problem. As it happens, it took
			us weeks to finally understand and resolve the problem.
